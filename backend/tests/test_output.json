With a shorter pool of applicants, you have a higher chance of winning a scholarship that was meant for you and your hometown.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about the Coca-Cola scholarship is that it is reported to be listed as a state-by-state scholarship opportunity. When only a limited number of Coca-Cola scholarships are given to each state, your opportunity to receive a Coca-Cola scholarship increases.\n\nInstead of competing nationally for a scholarship, you can receive one of a limited number of financial awards given to students in your state. This dramatically deceases the competitional nationwide, and gives you a better chance at winning financial help for college post-graduation.\n\nPage Not Found\n\n[Drive](https://drive.google.com/)\n\nSorry, the file you have requested does not exist.\n\nMake sure that you have the correct URL and the file exists.\n\n**Get stuff done with Google Drive**\n\nApps in Google Drive make it easy to create, store and share online documents, spreadsheets, presentations and more.\n\nLearn more at [drive.google.com/start/apps](https://drive.google.com/start/apps).\n\n## What is the Coca-Cola Scholarship?\n\nThe Coca-Cola company has created the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, which supports more than 1,400 exceptional college students every year.

Remember, you should never pay to apply for a scholarship or give out your social security information or banking information. If a website is asking for this information or is asking you to pay money, it is a scam. Most scholarships will only ask for general information such as name, age, address, phone number, high school, etc.\n\n2.
